### Abstract:
 - Zomato is one of the best online food delivery apps which gives the users the ratings and the reviews on restaurants all over india.These ratings and the Reviews are    considered as one of the most important deciding factors which determine how good a restaurant is.

 - We will therefore use the real time Data set with variuos features a user would look into regarding a restaurant. We will be considering Banglore City in this       analysis.
 
 ### Content:
  - The basic idea of analyzing the Zomato dataset is to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the establishment of different types of restaurant at different places in Bengaluru, aggregate rating of each restaurant, Bengaluru being one such city has more than 12,000 restaurants with restaurants serving dishes from all over the world.

 - With each day new restaurants opening the industry has’nt been saturated yet and the demand is increasing day by day. Inspite of increasing demand it however has become difficult for new restaurants to compete with established restaurants. Most of them serving the same food. Bengaluru being an IT capital of India. Most of the people here are dependent mainly on the restaurant food as they don’t have time to cook for themselves.

 - With such an overwhelming demand of restaurants it has therefore become important to study the demography of a location. What kind of a food is more popular in a locality. Do the entire locality loves vegetarian food. If yes then is that locality populated by a particular sect of people for eg. Jain, Marwaris, Gujaratis who are mostly vegetarian. These kind of analysis can be done using the data

### Main Objective:
 - The main agenda of this project is:

 - Perform extensive Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on the Zomato Dataset.

 - Build an appropriate Machine Learning Model that will help various Zomato Restaurants to predict their respective Ratings based on certain features

### Tools/Technology used to implement proposed solution:
 - Python 
 -  Pandas
 - Numpy 
 - Matplotlib 
 - Seaborn 
 - Plotly 
 - Sklearn 
 - Jupyter Notebook
 
 ### Conclusion: 
 - Our ExtraTree Regressor algorithm yields the highest accuracy, 93.28%. Any accuracy above 70% is considered good, but be careful because if your accuracy is extremely high, it may be too good to be true (an example of Overfitting). Thus, 80% is the ideal accuracy! 

 - Out of the 8 features we examined, the top 5 significant features that helped us to predict the rating (i.e.) rate, rest_type, votes, cuisines and book_table.

 - Our machine learning algorithm will able to predict the restaurant rating.

 - Based upon the analysis of the result, we can suggest the restaurant owners to improve the service type and what type of cuisines need to be provided and what type of dishes need to be included in the menu.
